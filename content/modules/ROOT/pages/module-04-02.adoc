= LlamaStack Observability

LlamaStack integrates with the Observability stack we deployed as part of the bootstrap. The observability stack has a lot of moving parts. Traces are sent from LlamaStack via OTEL to a Tempo sink endpoint. We can then view traces in OpenShift using the Observe > Traces dashboard.

. Edit the LlamaStack ConfigMap to add telemetry stanza with the service name, sinks and the OTEL Tracing endpoint which is set as an environment variable on the Deployment
